# drap-drop-html-table-rows
Trying to figure out how to use drag and drop rows in an HTML table.

This is just a simple example of an HTML table that is loaded from an ajax call to a JSON file.

Ultimately I like to be able to drag and drop a row and with that reorder the id field in the table based on id of the row dropped.

So if I had a list of items that are numbered I want to reorder the list (based on the id) on the page as well as update the order of the data in the database.
